                <blockquote>"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."</blockquote>

                After graduating university Siena struggled to find work any work as an artist so she was relieved when her old friend Jonah Riley managed to find her a position in the NSW Police as a forensic artist. While initially a precarious position Siena’s good work and aptitude for her job made her a valued member of the North Sydney police force.<br><br>
                Soon after she joined the force a serial killer began a reign of terror across North Sydney. Leaving a trail of disfigured corpses in his wake the killer continually eluded police and quickly gained infamy as the ‘Sydney Slasher’. Alongside Sergeant Jonah Riley, Siena worked tirelessly to try and bring the killer to justice gradually adding to a composite drawing of the killer based on various victim and witness reports. Constructing this portrait took a heavy toll on Siena’s mental health. This recurring struggle to develop a reconstruction of the Slasher, averaging many disparate portraits and creating a shadowy, half-human image left a deep imprint in her troubled mind as in her sleep-deprived and hyper-stressed state the unfinished image of the Slasher was the one consistent feature.<br>
                As the investigation progressed Siena and Jonah began to realise their commanding officer, Superintendent Wade was working to hinder their efforts on behalf of the government and wealthy developers. With the killings taking place in the high-income neighbourhoods of harbourside North Sydney, an area highly sought after by the investors who had redeveloped the now science district to the north, the killings provided an unpleasant but beneficial way to lower the value of the neighbourhood, allowing residents to be pushed out and developers to move in. Appalled, Siena convinced Jonah to strike out on their own. As rogue agents, they adopted call signs to maintain anonymity across their radio channels. Jonah dubbed himself Romeo and Siena Echo 59: Echo in reference to her interest in the police’s sonic weapons and 59 as the call code for ‘criminal mischief.’<br><br>

                <div class="drop-down-box" id="siena">
                    Over this time Siena became increasingly paranoid and emotionally affected by the horrors she was dealing with daily and as she developed closer bonds with people personally affected by the killings she was determined to do whatever it took to stop the killer.<br>
                    When the sixth victim was killed Siena and Jonah learnt that there had been another murder in that same house many years before. Suspecting a correlation, Siena dug deeper and met with Mrs Weingarten, the wife of the man killed. Though Mrs Weingarten suffered from mild dementia, Siena and Jonah were able to learn of the family’s history and pinpointed her son Michael as a prime suspect, a family photo also linking him to Siena’s drawing. Siena realised from Mrs Weingarten’s stories that each of the Slasher’s murders had taken place at a location significant to the boy. Realising this pattern they figured that the next killing would take place at the next most significant landmark in Michael’s life, the boarding school he had been sent to after killing his father.<br>
                    The boarding school, now abandoned due to abuse of the children by the staff, was a huge run down complex in the outskirts of North Sydney. Arriving at Jonah’s early the next night, Siena found him passed out drunk. Furious, she left a note and went to confront the Sydney Slasher on her own, where staking out the boarding school, Siena was ambushed and captured by Michael.<br>
                    Held captive, Siena was forced to endure the Slasher’s torture, as he began to carve a smiley face into her shoulder. Suddenly, Jonah, still hopelessly drunk stumbled into the room and shot at Michael, missing by a yard and collapsing in a heap. Aggravated, the Slasher, having carved half a smiley face into Siena’s skin, stabbed the knife into her shoulder for safekeeping and went to deal with Riley. Mitchell, grabbing the blade with her teeth, dropped it into her hand and managed to release herself, rushing upstairs in a desperate bid to escape. Suddenly she came to the realisation that she had left Jonah behind and accepting responsibility, she decides to overcome her fear and turned back for Michael.<br>
                    She hears him hunting her through the corridors and spots him through a crack, seeing that he has Jonah’s gun. Clearly at a severe disadvantage, she stalked him before tackling him and grappling for the gun, shooting Michael in the waist in the process, while he managed to bite into her leg. Both severely injured they clawed their way through the building, reaching the rooftop. Here they again grappled, bloody and weak. Fuelled by the memories of his victims and how he had damaged her, Siena decided Weingarten had to die and, holding him close, rolled off the edge of the building, just as a dreary Jonah arrived. As she fell, Mitchell, close to the wall, struck a small balcony, tossing Michael from her grip and catching her fall as the Sydney Slasher plummeted into the depths of the abandoned building.<br><br>
                    Eventually Siena returned to the police force where she continues to work as a forensic artist while training to be forensic scientist. However still shaken by her experiences with the Sydney Slasher and concerned by the corruption she discovered, Siena continues to use the identity of Echo 59 to fight crime in the streets of Sydney and ensure there is never another Slasher.<br>
                    Soon after, Sergeant Riley told her about the Silver Spectre and the growing Sydney Guard and recommended Siena join. She quickly did.<br><br>
