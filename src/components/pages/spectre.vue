                                    <blockquote>"I have never yet heard of a murderer who was not afraid of a ghost."</blockquote>

                                    Hugo had dreamed of being a superhero since his childhood so when he saw an infomercial promising ‘amazing physical abilities' he leapt at the chance, signing up despite warnings from his friends and family. This rash decision was also influenced by recent bouts of depression, causing him to question his self-worth and seek ways to better it. <br><br>

                                    He was accepted and sent to a facility owned by the corporation, ExoCorp. Here he underwent tests and minor experiments for a while with no success. Hugo was disappointed and deemed the endeavour hopeless, deciding to stop attending his sessions. After not turning up for several appointments some of the Velvet Knights arrived at his home. Hugo, finally feeling wanted, was convinced to return to ExoCorp. So he followed the Knights outside where they forcibly detained Hugo and returned him to ExoCorp where his captors claimed he was too important to be allowed to leave.<br><br>

                                    Hugo was angry with himself for being tricked and resolved to be uncooperative with the scientists. As a result they drugged him and the rest of his time in the facility passed as a blur.<br>
                                    Eventually Hugo awoke in a room, alone but for Phillip Dean, the owner of ExoCorp, and as he came to was shocked to discover he had no physical form. He was startled but elated, figuring it was his promised ability. That was until he was told that so far the process had been irreversible at which point he flipped and tried and tried to get away. For some reason he was unable to escape and Dean eventually managed to calm him down, explaining that they believed the trigger was a mental process. Hugo concentrated hard and managed to revert to a tangible state.<br><br>
                                    <div class="drop-down-box" id="spectre">
                                        Dean then began to tell Hugo how amazing this power was and how beneficial it could be.<br>
                                        He learnt that the Dean’s plan was to keep him captive, in order to test more, ensuring it was viable, then distribute the technology globally with the goal of bettering society.
                                        Despite his apparent goodwill Hugo was disagreeable, not wanting to be tricked again or have his power lost in further experimentation so when a commotion erupted in another ward he seized the opportunity to escape, this time succeeding.<br>
                                        After successfully escaping he decided that it would be best to keep what had happened secret, so that people don’t know about the technology and don’t flock to the corporation wanting superpowers of their own.<br>
                                        Hugo also decided that he might as well become the superhero he had wanted to be so he snuck back into ExoCorp and stole the suit designed for him.<br>
                                        With this he became the Silver Spectre and began his campaign to stop the work of ExoCorp.
