                <blockquote>"Every great story seems to start with a snake."</blockquote>

                When discrimination against Asians began, Nick, then a promising young lawyer, helped his friends Tongyi Shen and Jonathan Pan seek refuge in Chinatown. Here they happened upon a hidden Chinese syndicate, the Longying. Seeking protection and a means to empower themselves they joined their cause and spent years training there and immersing themselves in the syndicate.<br><br>
                During this time he lived in an apartment in Chinatown and completed his training as a lawyer, having long had a passion for the profession.
                However, as he worked in the business corruption became very evident and Nick was appalled. Coupled with this, due to his race, his work was made very difficult by the government and some of his coworkers, forcing himself to push himself hard to achieve anything.<br><br>
                Over this time the Longying became more powerful and conditions across the rest of Sydney worsened. Eventually Nick became so distraught with the state of the legal system he stopped his Longying training to commit to his profession and overcome the obstacles presented by his ethnicity.<br>
                While he was away a US raid crippled the Longying and Nick became furious.
                With the help of close friends, he put together his arsenal and left to become one of the first vigilantes, Viper.<br><br><br>
